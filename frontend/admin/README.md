# 📊 Admin Dashboard - BookNest

The **Admin Dashboard** is the core management system of the BookNest e-commerce platform. It is a fully custom-built internal tool designed to allow admins to **manage products, customers, orders, inventory** efficiently and safely.

This dashboard was built fro **scratch** using Vanilla PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS\*\* without relying on frameworks to demonstrate a strong understanding of backend logic, data integrity, and frontend achitecture.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Dashboard

The dashboard is designed to handle \*\*real- world e-commerce operations, including:

- Managing books and inventory
- Handling customer data and addresses
- Creating and editing orders with stock validation
